Founded in 2022, the Forensic Machine Learning Technology Center (ForMaLTeC) focuses mainly on basic research for machine learning as well as application-oriented methods using machine learning and deep learning in forensic science. It is the internal core facility for both the Forensic Institute in Zurich (FOR) and the Zurich Institute for Forensic Medicine (IRM) for all questions related to statistics and mathematical modeling.

Wherever forensic questions need to be identified and evaluated from data, ForMaLTeC offers a support. This support can range from data collection to the evaluation of already existing data with the help of computer algorithms and statistical models.

We support the expert in such a way that large amounts of data from one or even several sources can be evaluated more efficiently and effectively at the same time. This is particularly helpful for comparative studies and individualizations (same source vs. different source). For instance in the case of individual comparisons, or the comparison of an object that is part of a trail, or the comparison of traces with existing databases.

As we are dealing mostly with sensitive Data, we are focused on locally run applications.
